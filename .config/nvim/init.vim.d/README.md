# NeoVim configuration

All files (ending in `.vim`) in this directory are sourced by nvim upon startup.

They are loaded in alpha-numeric order, including directories. For example: a
file named `00-first.vim` will be loaded before `01-dir/00-second.vim`.

My nvim configuration is split up into files based on areas of config and
ordering needs.
