# Dependent git projects

This directory contains all the remote dependencies that these config files depends on.

To manage these dependencies, I use [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo). This combines the benefits of subtrees and submodules, while still being transparent for non-contributor users.
