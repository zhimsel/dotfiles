# ===================================================================
# Basic file attributes
# ===================================================================
# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types.
# One can use codes for 256 or more colors supported by modern terminals.
# The default color codes use the capabilities of an 8 color terminal
# with some additional attributes as per the following codes:
# Attribute codes:
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white

#NORMAL 00 # no color code at all
#FILE 00 # regular file: use no color at all
RESET 0 # reset to "normal" color
DIR 34 # directory
LINK 36 # symbolic link. (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
 # numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
MULTIHARDLINK 00 # regular file with more than one link
FIFO 33 # pipe
SOCK 01;35 # socket
DOOR 01;35 # door
BLK 33;01 # block device driver
CHR 33;01 # character device driver
ORPHAN 31 # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file ...
MISSING 00 # ... and the files they point to
SETUID 04 # file that is setuid (u+s)
SETGID 04 # file that is setgid (g+s)
CAPABILITY 00 # file with capability (very expensive to lookup)
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 04;34 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 34 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
STICKY 04;34 # dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable
# This is for files with execute permission:
EXEC 32

# ===================================================================
# File extension attributes
# ===================================================================
# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to color below. Put the suffix, a space, and the color init string.
# (and any comments you want to add after a '#').
# Suffixes are matched case insensitively, but if you define different
# init strings for separate cases, those will be honored.

# I probably won't ever add extension-based colors, but I'll leave the
# above instructions just in case.


# Subsequent TERM or COLORTERM entries, can be used to add / override
# config specific to those matching environment variables.
